# ‚Äî Automating Reports and Emails with Python... üêç

The file is based on the PyautoGUI and Pyperclip libraries for web browsing automation and Pandas for data analysis.
<br><br>
With this program in Python, just have the page open for the software to navigate, accessing a Google Drive and downloading a database in Excel. Soon after, you will analyze the table and repay the total billing and items sold during the month.
<br><br>
After the analysis, the program will open the email (the user must be logged in) and send the report to a list of pre-selected people.
